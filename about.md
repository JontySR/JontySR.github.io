Hiya, I'm Jonty, and I thought that my stupidly nerdy love for vim and typing would come in handy with revision.

To incorporate it, I'm using Jekyll and Github Pages to host some of my key points from revision, so I can easily access them at the last minute from anywhere.
I know the prospect of people reading this is unlikely, but I thought I'd brush up the site so I didn't look like a default noob.
