## Determining SHC

- Heater, circuit, thermometer, substance, insulation, ammeter and voltmeter, stopclock, balance.
- E = VIt
- Record voltage and current.
- Measure mass.
- Start stopclock and measure temperature.
- Stop stopclock and measure temperature.
- Plot temperature against time.
- Power divided by gradient and mass gives SHC.


## Investigating Coulomb's law

- Positively charged sphere on insulating rod on balance. Split to zero.
- Put another positive sphere above the first, and measure the distance between with a ruler.
- Use the reading on the balance to calculate the force on the ball.


## Measuring half-thickness

- Source and counter + receiver. Measure bg count rate to subtract from the values measured later.
- Measure count rate with no absorber.
- Add absorber, measure count rate, increase thickness, repeat.
- When the count rate is half the original, you've found the half-thickness.
