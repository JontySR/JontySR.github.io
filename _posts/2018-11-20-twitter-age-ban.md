## What I did

I was going through [my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/jontysr), changing the personal website URL and trying to beef it all up, and I see a *date of birth entry*.

> Why not? I should beef up my portfolio.

So I add my date of birth (I'm over 18, I might add).

This was a grave error. It warned me that adding a date of birth might affect my account standing.

## I'm over 18, I don't think I'm breaching terms and conditions, right?

**Wrong.**

In trying to comply with GDPR earlier this year (pretty terribly), Twitter introduced a [policy which would insta-ban](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17595112/twitter-banning-underage-users-lie-age) anyone who they suspected of being under 13 at the time of account creation.

This is the case... **even if they are now an adult** (although some users have still been banned erroneously, as I'm sure I have).

<br/>

## What have they done about it since all of this went down?

They released a press statement in July about it, essentially admitting how short-sighted their pseudo-solution was, but doing nothing about it.

The worst part is, if you get stuck by this and don't want to upload government-issued ID to Twitter or don't have access to a guardian's ID for any reason, there are **no other support streams to access Twitter on** to talk it through.

<br/>

## Dude, just give them the ID and fill in the form

Oh, and even when you give them what they want (a form and government-issued ID), it seems as though they are [unlikely to reply to most cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/945t3e/twitter_age_ban_selected_the_second_option_heres/) and any personal brand you've spend years building will become completely **null and void**.

<br/>

## UPDATE

Got my account back through all of that ID stuff. Give an ID of someone who was older than 13 at the time of account creation if you weren't.
