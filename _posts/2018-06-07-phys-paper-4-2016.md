## Capacitance

- In series, the charge across any two capacitors is the same.
- This means that, if the capacitance of one is different, its voltage is proportional to \\(\frac{1}{C}\\)

## Mass defect

- The mass defect is whatever extra or less mass there is after the reaction.

## Differences between fission and fusion

- Fusion produces one nucleus, fission produces two.
- Neutrons cause fission.

## Why high temperatures and pressures are necessary for fusion.

- There is electrostatic repulsion.
- Need high kinetic energies and to be pushed together to have great enough speeds to overcome repulsion.
- And get close enough for the strong nuclear force to attract them.

## Nature of the strong nuclear force

- Strong
- Acts between all nucleons
- Repulsive at less than a femtometre, attractive beyond that.
