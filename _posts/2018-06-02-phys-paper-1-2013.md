## Springs

- **Force constant**: Force exerted on the spring per unit extension.
- Whenever acceleration decreases, talk about how the *resultant* force has decreased.

## Ball falling in fluid

When travelling at a constant velocity, GPE is not converted to KE because v is constant.
Therefore, all GPE is converted to *thermal energy*.

## Centre of mass/gravity

- The *point* where all its *weight* is imagined to be.

## General

- Try to mention the equations behind your thinking as much as possible; they often get you marks.
- Double check powers match up in equations and their answers.

## Young modulus

- If something about a material is changed (e.g. length), the young modulus will always remain the same because it is a property of a material, so the linear part of the graph does not change.
