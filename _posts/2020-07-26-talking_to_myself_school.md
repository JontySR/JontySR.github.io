Around the start of this month, I was invited to my school's "Futures Day" for year 12s (~17 year olds) to discuss pathways after school.
I told them what 17 year old me would have wanted to know about what life has been like for the last few years.
Thinking it might be useful to someone else (yet also for vanity's sake), I'm sharing a version of it with you now, with added juicy personal bits.
Not sure there's any way that last part sounds good.

## Where I Am Now

I'm currently doing a Computer Science Degree Apprenticeship at the University of Birmingham, with PwC.
It involves a full-time Computer Science BSc at the University of Birmingham, spending the summers of the first two years working at PwC, as well as a full year between the end of the second summer and the start of fourth year, much like a sandwich course.

There's a pandemic on, and I've left Birmingham to live with my parents.
The security of living with family is helpful, but I'm fairly lonely and need to see people more.
When it comes to my anxieties, I'm afraid not much has changed in the past few years, apart from a fairly transformative relationship helping me to understand more about how my brain works (or doesn't).
I might talk about that last element in a future post.

## How I Got Here

When I started year 12, I saw myself going to university to study Physics, which also requires the necessary evil of a Maths A Level.
I went for an A Level in Computer Science too, as I'd enjoyed it at GCSE level and was very interested in it.
Maths turned from a necessary evil into an enjoyable puzzle with the addition (hilarious!) of good teaching, and I enjoyed Physics less and loved Computer Science more.
I wanted to go to university to study Computer Science.

"But why the degree apprenticeship?", I hear you scream.
"The financial independence of a salary, the non-existence of student debt.", I respond bluntly.
Essentially my reasoning was that of a purely monetary nature, with a focus on not having to pay to learn more about something I love.
There were a few hoops to jump through during the application process, but nothing worth doing is easy, right? *sighs*

Really though, it was just a UCAS application, plus an application sent to PwC for them to review and upon passing through that, an assessment day which included a group psychometric test and an interview.

## What My First Placement Was Like

I could write a whole post on this, but it would probably be a bit of a downer, so I'll be concise. My experience was fairly unusual for my cohort, as my job took me out of the country to Rotterdam and Katowice. It's safe to say that while I gained a great deal of experience, I didn’t enjoy my placement so much.

One thing others have remarked excitedly at (including me, at first) is all the "travel" involved.
One thing I caught onto fairly quickly is that when your work is arduous and time-consuming, this "travel" is really just a soul-destroying, lengthy commute.

Retrospectively, I should’ve spoken to someone to be placed elsewhere, as I feel that my placement wasn't particularly aligned with my skills in technology, nor what I put down on my interests survey.
Other people I know did switch teams during the placement, so it would have been possible for me to follow suit and one could argue that I'm a bit of a mug for not doing just that.

Coinciding with this job stress was the crushing blow delivered by a break-up, which coloured that particular summer a very dark shade of whatever colour might describe a mental health breakdown.
But that's all done, and after another solid but abruptly ended academic year, I'm likely to be in a more data science-oriented team, which I'm looking forward to quite a bit.
Onwards and upwards.

## Where I Want to Be Next

Because I'm not particularly qualified to give sage advice, I'll let you know what I think I need to improve upon and it might prove useful.
Everyone will say this, but it's important to be bold and just do the things you constantly romanticise about doing.
I don't do that, and I need more than anything to get out of my comfort zone in the real world, so I might grow to be more comfortable with my own thoughts.

I dwell on bad repeats too much in my mind, like a slob glued to the TV watching back-to-back episodes of Jeremy Kyle, and going hiking alone or waking up early to find a spot to capture the sunrise or jumping into learning new things without caring what people think might introduce something fresh.
