## Reminders

- If you know something has a lower kinetic energy after a collision, *always* mention that it it because the collision is *inelastic*.
- When dealing with collisions and momentum where a change of direction takes place, add signs to the velocities.
- KE rarely converts to sound energy; it's safer to say *thermal*.
- In an ideal gas, all internal energy is assumes to be kinetic energy; no potential.
