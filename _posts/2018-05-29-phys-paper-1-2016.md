## Factors that affect magnitude of drag force

- Speed
- Surface area
- Density of fluid
- Streamlining

- **NOT** mass!


## How airbags reduce the impact force on a driver

- Decreases stopping distance for the driver.
- Magnitude of deceleration is smaller.
- F is proportional to a.


## How a GPS receiver determines the distance between the car and the satellite

- Time taken for signal to travel from satellite to car.
- Multiply by speed of light.


## Spring constants explanation in parallel

- Tension in each spring is halved because the load is shared across two springs equally, so the extension is also halved (if both springs identical).
