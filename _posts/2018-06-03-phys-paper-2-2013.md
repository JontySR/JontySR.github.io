## Resistance

- The definition is simply \\(\frac{potential~difference}{current}\\)

## Differences between stationary and progressive wave

1. Energy transfer in direction.
2. Oscillations transfer shape.

## General

- If asked to draw direction of motion for a particle, draw the arrow towards 0 displacement every time.
- When asked a "show that" question and the value is used in a later part, use the value you calculated, *not* the given (often rounded) value.

## Why EM waves can be polarised but sound waves cannot

- Only transverse waves can be.

## Electron volt

- Energy to accelerate an electron through a p.d. of 1V.

## Phase difference

- \\( \pi \\) radians: antiphase (dark fringe)
- \\( 2 \pi \\) radians: in phase (light fringe)
