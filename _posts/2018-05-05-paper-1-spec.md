## Uncertainties

### Addition/subtraction

Add *absolute* uncertainties.

### Multiplication/division

Add *percentage* uncertainties.

### Powers

Multiply *percentage* uncertainty by power.

## Springs (LIKE CAPACITORS)

### In parallel

Spring constants add. 

### In series

\$$ k_T = (k_1^{-1} + k_2^{-1} + ...)^{-1} $$

---

## Measurements

Don't forget measurements in practical explanations.

## Why is rubber a good tyre material?

1. Elastic, so returns to original shape.
2. Area under F-x graph is work done.
3. When force is removed, the wheels won't bounce much, because *some energy is given off as heat*.

---

## Ensuring accurate results when measuring pressure, using a water bath.

1. Ensure largest possible volume of flask (containing gas) is submerged.
2. Make volume of tubing small compared to volume of container.
3. Remove heat source and stir water to ensure water is at a uniform temperature throughout.
4. Allow time for heat energy to transfer through the container to the gas *before* reading the temperature.

## Anything to do with SHM

Just say that:

1. EPE -> KE.
2. Accel. prop. to disp. from centre, in opposite direction, towards the centre.

---

## Experimentally obtaining disp-time graph for an oscillating mass

1. Motion sensor connected to data logger which sends info on disp & time to the computer.
2. Sensor *placed close to moving mass* to eliminate reflections from other objects.
3. Small reflector attached to mass.

4. Any attached reflector *should not cause dampening*.
5. Use thin supports to reduce reflections.

## Anything about stellar parallax and distances

State what stellar parallax is and the definition of the parsec:

1. Stellar parallax is caused by the *Earth's orbit around the Sun*.
2. It's the *apparent motion* of a star relative to the position of *more distant* stars.
3. Angle of parallax one arcsecond when the displacement of Earth from the Sun is 1AU corresponds to the distance 1pc.

---

## Why is *hydrogen* often used to measure a star's velocity?

1. There's *lots of hydrogen in stars*.
2. Intensity of light from other elements may be too low for *accurate* measurement.

## Information supporting the Big Bang theory

### Description of Big Bang theory

1. Predicts that all galaxies will be receding.
2. Recession speed proportional to distance from Earth.
3. Universe exploded into existence from small, hot and dense point.

### CMBR

1. During early Big Bang, the universe was supposedly rich with high energy gamma photons.
2. Expansion caused a red shift of these waves into microwave photons.
3. The *intensity* of CMBR is uniform in all directions.
4. Corresponds to a temperature of 2.7K

### Red shift

1. Anything contextually related to red shift in the question.
2. Change in wavelength caused by motion of other galaxies (Doppler Effect).
3. These galaxies are receding (if contextual, give data).
4. Most galaxies are receding, providing evidence for the Big Bang.

### Blue shift

1. If there is any contextual data for blue shift, mention it.
2. Blue shift, caused by motion towards Earth *not related to Big Bang theory directly*.
3. Blue shift is due to *gravitational* pull.
