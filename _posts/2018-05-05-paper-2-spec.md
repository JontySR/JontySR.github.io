## Photons

1. Have no charge.
2. All travel at the same speed in a vacuum.
3. Have energies depending *only* on their frequencies.

---

## X-ray tubes

1. \\( \lambda_0 \\) is halved when V is doubled.
2. \\( \lambda_0 \\) is unchanged when the temperature of the cathode is increased.
3. \\( \lambda_0 \\) is independent of the cathode material.

## Quark decay

Decay is caused by the *weak nuclear* force.

## Potential divider circuit with a thermistor

1. Total resistance in the circuit decreases as temperature increases because thermistor is in series with fixed resistor.
2. Current in circuit increases as temperature increases.
3. Therefore potential difference across the fixed resistor increases as the potential difference across the thermistor decreases.

4. Show calculation if asked, based on the context.
5. Typical limitations (based on typical graphs):
    - The change in y is small between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).
    - Change in something's reading is too small.
    - Graph is non-linear.

## Photoelectric effect

Emission of photoelectrons from the *surface of a metal*, when incident EM waves have a frequency above the threshold frequency of the metal.

---

## Explain why the photoelectric effect cannot be explained in terms of the wave-model of EM waves

1. Wave model cannot explain why there is a *threshold frequency* for metals.
2. Photon model proposed a *one-to-one interaction between photons and electrons*, which explains why a threshold frequency exists.
3. KE of emitted electrons is independent from incident wave intensity.
4. Energy of photon (hf) must be greater than or equal to the work function \\( \phi \\) of the metal.
5. Mention \\( hf = \phi + \frac{1}{2} m v_{max}^2 \\).

## Explain how capacitor plates acquire opposite charges

1. Electrons flow in [direction] to [plate], where they are deposited.
2. An equal number of electrons are removed from the opposite plate, giving it a positive charge of equal magnitude.

---

## Measuring time constant experimentally

1. Close switch to charge capacitor. Voltmeter across capacitor.
2. Stopwatch started when switch opened, stopped when p.d. or current reaches ~37% of its original value.
3. Time constant is the time taken for p.d. or current to decrease to 37% of its original value.

## Similarities and differences between gravitational fields and electric fields

1. Force exerted both inversely prop. to separation squared.
2. One prop. to charge, one mass.
3. Gravitational fields are always attractive.
