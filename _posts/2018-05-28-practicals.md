## Determining g by plotting a graph

### Setup

- *Measure* the distance fallen with a ruler.
- Electromagnet holds a steel ball over a trapdoor.
- The current in the circuit is removed, which *starts the timer* and *turns the electromagnet off*, causing the ball to drop.
- When it hits the trapdoor, electrical contact is broken again and the timer stops.
- Repeat with multiple drop heights.

### Interpreting results

- \\(s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2\\)
- \\(u\\) = 0 because ball starts from rest.
- \\(s = \frac{1}{2} gt^2\\)

- Plot graph of height \\(s\\) against time taken squared \\(t^2\\).
- Draw a line of best fit.
- The graph should be a *straight* line through the *origin*, with the gradient \\(\frac{1}{2} g\\).

### Sources of inaccuracies

- Air resistance, reduced with a *heavier ball*.
- Residual magnetism, reduced with a *bigger drop*.


## Investigating motion in a fluid

- Motion sensor connected to data-logger or computer.
- Falling object attached via a thin thread to a polystyrene ball on the other side of a pulley.
- The motion of the polystyrene ball will be the same as that of the object.
- Generate and analyse velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs with this data.


## Collecting data for an I-V characteristic

### Setup 1

- Supply
- Ammeter and *variable resistor* in parallel with component
- Voltmeter across the component

### Setup 2

- Supply
- *Potential divider* with the following over it:
- Ammeter and component in parallel
- Voltmeter across component


## Determining resistivity

- Investigate how resistance varies with *length*.
- Use the same diameter wire. Measure diameter with *calipers* to calculate the cross-sectional area A.
- Circuit: ammeter, and wire in parallel, voltmeter across wire.
- Measure p.d. and current across different lengths of wire.
- Use \\( R = \frac{V}{I} \\) to calculate the resistance for each length.
- Plot R against L (straight line through origin).
- Gradient is \\( \frac{\rho}{L} \\).
- Multiply by A to get \\( \rho \\).


## Investigating internal resistance

- Variable resistor in parallel with ammeter.
- Voltmeter over source.
- Change resistance and plot V against I.
- Straight line of best fit with y intercept E.
- \\( V = -Ir + E \\) where E is the total e.m.f., r is the source's internal resistance. 
- Gradient is -r.


## Temperature-sensing circuits

- Potential divider circuit with R2 as a thermistor and R1 as fixed resistor.
- As temperature increases, resistance of thermistor decreases and so V-out drops.


## Light-sensing circuits

- Potential divider circuit with R1 as an LDR and R2 as fixed resistor.
- As light intensity increases, the resistance of the LDR falls and so the p.d. across it decreases.
- R2 receives a greater proportion of the p.d. so V-out increases.


## Polarisation of light

- Unpolarised light passing through the first filter becomes plane polarised.
- If the second filter is in the same plane as the first, then the light passes through it unaffected.
- As the second filter is slowly rotated, the intensity of the light transmitted through it drops.
- When the second filter has turned through 90 degrees, no light is transmitted and the intensity falls to zero.


## Interference in sound

- Two loudspeakers connected to the same signal generator will emit coherent (constant phase difference and frequency) waves.
- The sound waves overlap, forming an *interference* pattern.
- The interference pattern comprises of minima and maxima.
- The positions of these can be detected accurately with a microphone.


## Interference in microwaves

- A *single* microwave source is used along with a pair of slits.
- These waves overlap and form an interference pattern that can be detected with a microwave receiver connected to a voltmeter or oscilloscope.
- Moving the receiver in an arc around the double slit allows you to find the maxima and minima as part of the interference pattern.
- The position of each can be marked on a piece of paper.


## Determining the wavelength of monochromatic light from a laser

- Double slit setup with a laser behind it.
- Measure the distance between several bright fringes.
- The separation x between adjacent fringes can be determined with a ruler.
- Use slit separation a and distance from screen D to calculate wavelength.


## Investigating stationary waves on strings

- Vibration generator can be used to change the frequency of the wave on the stretched string until a stable stationary wave is produced for a specific harmonic.
- The generator must be set to an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency or no stationary wave will be formed.
- The length of the string can be changed, or the fixed end can be replaced with a pulley and different masses to add tension.


## Speed of sound in a resonance tube

- Hold tuning fork above a tube closed at one end can form a stationary wave inside the tube at the same frequency as the tuning fork.
- If the tuning fork frequency is at the fundamental frequency of the air column, the sound becomes loud as the air resonates.
- Length of the tube can be changed by raising and lowering it into water.
- When the frequency of the fork matches \\(f_0\\), the length L of the tube is equal to \\(\frac{1}{4}\lambda\\).
- Speed of sound calculated with \\(v = f \lambda\\).
