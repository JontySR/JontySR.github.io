## General

- Use the simplest equation you can find in most cases.
- You often need to convert to current to prove things, especially in series.

## Power

- Greater power, lower resistance, greater cross-sectional area of wire.
- **Kilowatt-hour**: energy of 1kW for 1 hour (that simple)

## Charging circuits

- Positive terminal of the battery faces the positive end of the charger, in order to transfer energy to the battery.
- Current is drawn from positive of charger to positive of battery.

## Waves

- **Amplitude**: the maximum displacement *from equilibrium*.
- Detected signal of interfering microwaves changes laterally because the *path difference* changes, and minima (antiphase) and maxima (in phase) are detected.
- Amplitude decreases with distance because the energy emitted "spreads out".
