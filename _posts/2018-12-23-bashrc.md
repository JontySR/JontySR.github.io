## My motivation to make this

If you don't care about this and want the juicy info, skip to [how my bashrc is configured]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-23-bashrc %}#how-my-bashrc-is-configured).

I used to use bash.
Then [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).
Then [fish](https://fishshell.com/).
And now I'm at bash again.
I wanna tell people how to get the features they think are coolest from these shells easily on the default shell of many Linux distributions.

<!-- more -->

### Why zsh?

It had a load of cool features, and it seemed easy to set up.
Turns out, when there are lots of neat features that are optional and when you care about how your prompt looks, you actually spend a lot of time configuring it anyway (like I did).

### Why fish?

It had many cool features, and less set up time than zsh.
I had it how I wanted it in the end, so why did I switch again?

### Back to bash?

- I'm an indecisive idiot.
- Bash is simpler, and feels like it has fewer files to mess with.
- Bash is more widely adopted (doesn't really matter in my case but whatever).

In the end, I just really didn't want so much other stuff (I do miss auto-colouring of commands from fish, but I found it so useless).
What I missed from zsh and fish is the cool prompts headlined to show git info and shorten the prompt current directory (pwd).

Luckily, this is pretty trivial to set up in `~/.bashrc`. ðŸ˜‰

## How my bashrc is configured

### Shortening the prompt

I wanted to shorten the prompt by shortening all directory names apart from the current one to their first letter only.
This bit is made super simple by regular expressions.
Just put this small procedure into `~/.bashrc`:

```
short_pwd() {
  local pwd=$(pwd)
  pwd=${pwd/#$HOME/\~}
  sed 's:\([^/]\)[^/]*/:\1/:g' <<<"$pwd"
}
```

Note that this function needs to actually be called for our prompt when its drawn, which I'll demonstrate later on.

### Showing a git status for the current git project

This section is long but dirty.
Much like the short pwd function, paste these into the same file:

```
# get current branch in git repo
function parse_git_branch() {
    BRANCH=`git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/\1/'`
    if [ ! "${BRANCH}" == "" ]
    then
        STAT=`parse_git_dirty`
        echo "[${BRANCH}${STAT}] "
    else
        echo ""
    fi
}

# get current status of git repo
function parse_git_dirty {
    status=`git status 2>&1 | tee`
    dirty=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "modified:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    untracked=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "Untracked files" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    ahead=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "Your branch is ahead of" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    newfile=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "new file:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    renamed=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "renamed:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    deleted=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "deleted:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
    bits=''
    if [ "${renamed}" == "0" ]; then
        bits=">${bits}"
    fi
    if [ "${ahead}" == "0" ]; then
        bits="*${bits}"
    fi
    if [ "${newfile}" == "0" ]; then
        bits="+${bits}"
    fi
    if [ "${untracked}" == "0" ]; then
        bits="?${bits}"
    fi
    if [ "${deleted}" == "0" ]; then
        bits="x${bits}"
    fi
    if [ "${dirty}" == "0" ]; then
        bits="!${bits}"
    fi
    if [ ! "${bits}" == "" ]; then
        echo " ${bits}"
    else
        echo ""
    fi
}
```

### Using these functions in the prompt

It's as easy as adding them to your `PS1` with:

```
PS1="\u \`short_pwd\` \`parse_git_branch\`"
```

The above prompt displays my username, the short pwd and the git branch status.
You might've noticed the different colours in the image above---this involves some terminal escape sequences I haven't included here, but I do have my full bashrc uploaded with my dotfiles [here](https://gitlab.com/JontySR/dots/blob/master/bash/.bashrc).

### Some other neat parts of my bashrc

It's essentially built from the default Debian/Ubuntu bashrc, so it sources a bash completion file (bash completion available from most official distro repositories if you don't have it) and bash aliases where all my alias commands are held.

It also contains a few checks for whether the terminal should support 256 colour codes and, if it does, it sets the colour on or off for commands like ls and the colours for the prompt accordingly.
