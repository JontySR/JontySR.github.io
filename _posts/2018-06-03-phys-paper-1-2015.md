## Calculating average velocity from a flight path

- Because it's *velocity*, calculate the displacement; direct distance from A to B.

## General

- Always talk about net force when there is acceleration/no acceleration.

## Rubber stress-strain graph observations

- Elastic.
- Does not obey Hooke's law.
- Loading and unloading graphs differ.
