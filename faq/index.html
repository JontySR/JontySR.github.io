    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>How do I ssh into the CS server?</h2>
    <p>Type <code>ssh tinky-winky.cs.bham.ac.uk</code> and input your username and password.</p>
    <h2>Why can't I use gedit over ssh?</h2>
    <p>You can (put -X after ssh in the command above), but you shouldn't (see below). The reason you can't without -X is that gedit is a graphical application, and the only thing being directed through ssh is the terminal screen you see.</p>
    <h2>Why shouldn't I direct the display server through ssh?</h2>
    <p>Because it's sending all of that window information over the internet, and that's gonna be laggy and unusable.</p>
    <h2>What can I use for editing my files on the CS server then?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>scp (copy the files over via ssh) (<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp" target="_blank">See this page for more info</a>)</li>
      <li>sshfs (setup a virtual ssh filesystem so you can access your stuff with your native applications) (<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs" target="_blank">See this page for more info</a>)</li>
      <li>Use git, it's really good at doing this stuff and you'll need to learn it at some point. Create an account at gitlab.com or github.com and set up a new repository. (<a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" target="_blank">See this page for git commands and some brilliant explanations</a>)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>This right here is crazy talk. Why can't I just use a USB like everyone else?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You'll have to remember to transfer everything over every time you work.</li>
      <li>Everyone loses their USBs by leaving them plugged in.</li>
      <li>You're a CS student and deserve more efficient ways to improve your workflow.</li>
      <li>Bragging rights.</li>
      <li>You'll probably have to use one of the above at some point and it will be under practical circumstances, so do it now.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Git is denying access to the repo for the first time</h2>
    <p>Log into <a href=https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk>the GitLab login page</a> first.</p>
    <h2>I did, and it's still denying me access</h2>
    <p>Type <code>git config --global --unset credential.helper</code> and
      <code>git config --system --unset credential.helper</code> (to make
      sure). This is because git has cached your credentials for a while.</p>
    <h2>Is [insert session here] on today?</h2>
    <p>Check canvas announcements, canvas groups, your timetable, etc.</p>
